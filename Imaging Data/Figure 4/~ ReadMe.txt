The 'Raw Images' directory contains the conjugate pairs that data was generated from.
The files are divided by cell type and antibody condition (ritxumab, +Rtx or no rituximab).
In each folder are processed cell conjugates where background has been subtracted and Z projects have
been used to create a 2D image.
The unprocessed raw images are also present.
The 'Figure Images' directory contains the conjugate pairs used as represetative images in figure 4.
The represented images were taken based on the polarization of the MTOC
and come from the following raw images:
VL + Rtx, Image 22. MTOC distance 0.2896 radii (average 0.5017)
VH + Rtx, Image 05. MTOC distance 0.2137 radii (average 0.3641)
FL + Rtx, Image 27. MTOC distance 0.9865 radii (average 0.6804)
VL - Rtx, Image 02. MTOC distance 0.4660 radii (average 0.6894)
VH - Rtx, Image 04. MTOC distance 0.8474 radii (average 0.6929)
FL - Rtx, Image 15. MTOC distance 0.8031 radii (average 0.6854)
