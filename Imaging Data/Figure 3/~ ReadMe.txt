Figure 3 - 
Image montages from the latest experiment (06/09/2023) for the serial killing experiments described in figure 3.
Raw images are arranged by cell type (NK-92 expessing CD16 158V-48L or 48H) and frame (s1-4).
Individual files are further divided by the channel and the timepoint.
Channels:
w1 - transmitted light
w2 - SYTO far red
w3 - Hoechst
w4 - Caspase 3/7 dye
Timepoints:
t1-97, each icrement is equal to a 5 minute elapse in time.
Images of representative tracks (figure 3c) are taken from VL/s1 and VH/s2.
Tracking data for this experiment is located in Maskalenko2024/Figure Data/,
which can be used to reconstruct Figure 3d.
