Figure 5 - 
The 'Raw Images' directory contains the images masks were assembled from and measured.
In some images, where a second NK cell appears in the corner of an image, the measured
cell is the more central of the two.
Measurements of the masks are contained in the 'Raw Measurements' directory.
The 'Area' value of the binary masks was used for the figure, but other useful information
such as the centroids (XM,YM) of these footprints are also here.
Full 30 minute montages of the cells used in the figure are included in the "Figure Images"
directory.
L52 and H07 are the cells chosen to be included in the figure.
Representative figures were chosen based on proximity to the mean of the average IRM footprint,
being the overall size of the synaptic area
L52 has an IRM 'Area' of 115.871 (mean for L = 113.990)
H07 has an IRM 'Area' of 93.899 (mean for H = 92.346)
