Image montages from the latest experiment (04/29/22) for the cytotoxicity experiments described in figure 2.
Raw images are arranged by cell type (NK-92 expessing CD16 158V-48L or 48H and CD16 158F-48L), E:T ration (1:1-5) and frame (s1-4).
Individual files are further divided by the channel and the timepoint.
Channels:
w1 - transmitted light
w2 - SYTO far red
w3 - Hoechst
w4 - Caspase 3/7 dye
Timepoints:
t1-33, each icrement is equal to a 15 minute elapse in time.
